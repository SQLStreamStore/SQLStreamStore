# SQL Stream Store [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SQLStreamStore/SQLStreamStore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SQLStreamStore/SQLStreamStore)

used in Event Sourced based applications.

# Design considerations:

 - Designed to only ever support RDMBS\SQL implementations.
 - Subscriptions are eventually consistent.
 - API is influenced by (but not compatible with) [EventStore](https://eventstore.org/).
 - Async only.
 - JSON only event and metadata payloads (usually just a `string` / `varchar` / etc).
 - No support for `System.Transaction` enforcing the concept of the stream as the consistency and transaction boundary.

# Building

Building requires Docker. Solution and tests are run on a linux container with .net core leveraging SQL Server and Postgres as sibling containers.

 - Widows, run `.\build.cmd`
 - Linux, run `./build.sh`

Note: build does not work via WSL.
